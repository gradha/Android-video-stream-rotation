=============================
Added Support For Loading Video Dialog
=============================

Since Adam did the nice job by setting up an video player which takes care of screen orientation , i thought of adding
support of loading video dialog which shows the user a dialog saying "Loading video" instead of a blank screen.

What's Changed
==============

  Changes are only inside "HelloInterruptVideoStream.java" file.

General
=======

This test contains a limited video player able to stream a .3gp file from
internet. The video will be shown centered full screen, maintaining the video
aspect ratio. Also, rotations don't interrupt the video, which keeps playing
without problems.

Everything seems fine, but... on my HTC Legend when you rotate back to
portrait, the video is corrupted, and instead of showing full screen it is
displayed at its native pixel size. But rotating again to landscape works and
is shown perfectly. Any ideas why? Unfortunately I don't have more hardware to
test this on.

I'm asking also on StackOverflow at
